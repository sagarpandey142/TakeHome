 Full Stack Developer Take-Home Assignment

This project is a containerized full-stack application consisting of a Product Service, a Segment Service, and a Frontend.
It demonstrates API integration, periodic data ingestion from WooCommerce, MongoDB storage, and API visualization using Swagger.

 Tech Stack

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: MongoDB

Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose

API Docs: Swagger (OpenAPI)

🚀 Quick Start
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd takehome

2️⃣ Create .env files

Copy the example files for each service:

cp product-service/.env.example product-service/.env
cp segment-service/.env.example segment-service/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

3️⃣ Run using Docker Compose
docker compose up --build


Once built, all services will start automatically.

🌐 Service URLs
Service	URL
Frontend	http://localhost:3000

Product Service	http://localhost:4000/products

Segment Service	http://localhost:4100/segments/evaluate

Swagger Docs (Product)	http://localhost:4000/docs

Swagger Docs (Segment)	http://localhost:4100/docs
🕐 Cron-based Product Ingestion

The Product Service automatically fetches and updates products from the WooCommerce API periodically using a cron job (default: every 15 minutes).
This ensures the database remains up-to-date without manual triggers.

🧾 API Visualization (Swagger)

All backend APIs are documented using Swagger (OpenAPI).
Visit the /docs route of each backend service to view and test endpoints interactively.

🧠 AI Usage Note

Parts of this assignment (specifically code explanation, Swagger documentation setup, and README structure) were written with assistance from AI (ChatGPT) for clarity and formatting.
All business logic, integration, and final implementation were manually written and verified.

🧩 Folder Structure
takehome/
├── docker-compose.yml

├── segment-service/
└── frontend/

🧪 Testing

Use Swagger UI or Postman to test endpoints.

Example request for segment evaluation:

{
  "rules": "price > 1000\nstock_status = instock\non_sale = true"
}

✅ Notes

Default cron interval: */15 * * * * (every 15 minutes)

All ports are configurable through .env files

Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is running before execution
